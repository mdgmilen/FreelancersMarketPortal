# FreelancersMarketPortal project  
  
Last update: 04May2023  
Summary:     Still, the quantity of the source-code is too low, i.e. it cannot be used to get a reasonable idea for my programming skills.  
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  FreempSproduct microservice repo was created.  
  
  
The current repo is planned to be like a parent of all microservices' repos (with prefix FreeMPXxx /FreempXxx) the FreelancersMarketPortal product /solution consists of. It will hold architecture and other documents describing the product (eco-system of microservices) and all artefacts /items which are not part of any microservice.  
  
Currently, the main two /2 purposes of the current repo (and all its child-repos) are:  
1of2- for me, to exercise the full (end-to-end) tech-stack used in the Microservices architecture.  
I have been involved in Microservices projects, but I have worked with many colleagues and missed to build hands-on skills on the full-tech-stack.
Hence, currently, I'm the only developer using these repositories.  
  
2of2- for my near-future employers /contractors /partners /clients to review my source-code delivered here, to assess its quality and to decide, if they would like to work with me.  
  
  
Business logic /purpose: FreelancersMarketPortal meets clients with freelance workers and ensures satisfaction for both sides! Our freelancers supply services to clients on all business domains, e.g. software development, language translations, law councelling, life-coaching /pshycho-terapy and many others.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Bad practices in the current project:  
- no tool like Sonar Qube is used.  
  "Empower development teams with a solution that deeply integrates into your enterprise environment and enables you to deploy clean code consistently and reliably";  
- no unit-tests are planned to be implemented;  
- no feature-branches are planned to be used. The only branch is "main". There is no branch called "master".

Summary:     Currently, the project (all repos with prefix FreeMP_xxx /Freemp_xxx) is empty, it contains only the current file.
