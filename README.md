# FreelancersMarketPortal project  
  
Last update: 17May2024
Summary:
- Still, the quantity of the source-code here is too low, i.e. it cannot be used to get a reasonable idea for my (MilenG) programming skills;
- This project with all the microservices is planned as Cloud Native.
  
Prev update: Mar2023
- FreempSproduct microservice repo was created.

Usage:  
&nbsp;&nbsp; Open http://masters.improve1.com/  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
The current repo is planned to be like a parent of all microservices' repos (with prefix FreeMPXxx /FreempXxx) the FreelancersMarketPortal product /solution consists of. It will hold architecture and other documents describing the product (eco-system of microservices) and all artefacts /items which are not part of any microservice.  
  
&nbsp;  
Currently, the main two /2 purposes for the existance of the current repo (and all its child-repos) are:
- 1of2 For me (MilenG), to exercise the full (end-to-end) tech-stack used in the Microservices architecture.  
&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been involved in Microservices projects, but I have worked with many colleagues and missed to build hands-on skills  
&nbsp;&nbsp; on the full-tech-stack. Hence, currently, I'm the only developer using these repositories.  
- 2of2 For my near-future employers /contractors /partners /clients to review my source-code delivered here, to assess its quality and to decide, if they would like to work with me.  
  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
Business logic /purpose:  
&nbsp;&nbsp; FreelancersMarketPortal meets clients with freelance workers and ensures satisfaction for both sides! Our freelancers supply services to clients on all business domains, e.g. software development, language translations, law councelling, life-coaching /pshycho-terapy and many others.  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
Bad practices in the current project:  
- no tool like Sonar Qube is used.  
  "Empower development teams with a solution that deeply integrates into your enterprise environment and enables you to deploy clean code consistently and reliably";  
- no unit-tests are planned to be implemented;  
- no feature-branches are planned to be used. The only branch is "main". There is no branch called "master";  
- User Authentication micro-service is planned for the latter development stages (scrum sprints).
