# FreelancersMarketPortal

Last update: 28Apr2023  
Summary:     Currently, the project (all repos with prefix FreeMP_xxx) is empty, it contains only the current file.

FreelancersMarketPortal meets clients with freelance workers and ensures satisfaction for both sides! Our freelancers supply services to clients on all business domains, e.g. software development, language translations, law councelling, life-coaching /pshycho-terapy and many others.

The current repo is planned to be like a parent of all microservices repos the FreelancersMarketPortal product consists of. It will hold architecture and other documents describing the product and all artefacts /items which are not part of any microservice.
